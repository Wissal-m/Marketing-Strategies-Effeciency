In this project, I explored the impact of various promotion budgets—including TV, Radio, and social media—on sales performance.  
I utilized machine learning techniques to quantify how different allocation strategies influence sales, starting with linear regression for initial insights.
To enhance predictive accuracy and model robustness, I further employed neural networks, Random Forest, and XGBoost to identify the best-performing model. 
This project showcases my ability to combine traditional and advanced machine learning models to drive data-driven marketing decisions.
